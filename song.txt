Another verse another search for something holy
Another chance to make it right
When it's young and it's fun there's nothing lost nothing won
And no consequence in sight
You know it only feels like darkness
When the light doesn't shine on your side
You were the poet I was the poem but were you mine were you your own
Or were we fighting for our lives
It doesn't matter we survived
But if I could have
One last time with you
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine with you
